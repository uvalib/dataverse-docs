Finding and Using Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Finding Data
=============

Without logging in, users can browse, search for dataverses, datasets, and files, view dataset descriptions and files for published datasets, and subset, analyze and visualize data for published (restricted & not restricted) data
files. To view a unpublished dataverse, dataset, or file, a user will need to be given permission from that dataverse’s administrator to access it.

A user can search the dataverses, datasets, and files within a particular dataverse by using the search bar found on the left side of a dataverse page. For example, if you are in the Environmental Science Dataverse page, you can search that specific dataverse’s contents by using the search bar and/or facets displayed on the page.  

Basic Search
--------------
From a Dataverse homepage, you can begin searching that dataverse with an exact phrase search or entering a search term or query in the search box (on the left) that says, "Search this dataverse". If you have navigated to a sub-dataverse, to search ALL dataverses, use the search dropdown on the header of every page. 

Sorting and Viewing Search Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Facets: to the left of the search results, there are several facets a user can click on to narrow the number of results displayed. 
    - Choosing a facet: to choose a facet, click on the facet to choose it
    - Removing a facet: to remove a facet, click on the X next to a chosen facet in search string above the results OR a chosen facet can be removed by clicking on the X next to it in the facets pane to the left of the results
    - Viewing more or less: the top five results show in each facet, to view more, click on "More..." in the bottom right of a facet. Once you've chosen to see more, an option to view less will appear in the bottom left of the facet.
   
Results: after entering a search term or query, results (dataverses, datasets, or data files) that match your term or query appear underneath the search bar and to the right of the facets.
    - Relevancy of results: each results shows which metadata fields match the search query or term you entered into the search bar with the matching term or query bolded. If the search term or query was found in the title or name of the dataverse, dataset, or file, the search term or query will be bolded within it.

Other basic search features: 
    - Sorting results: search results can be sorted by name (A-Z or Z-A), newest or oldest, or relevancy of results. The sort button can be found above the search results, in the top right.
    - Bookmarkable URLs: search URLs can be copied and sent to a fellow researcher or can be bookmarked for you to be able to return to at a later time.


Advanced Search 
-----------------

In an advanced search, you can refine your criteria by choosing which metadata fields to search. You can perform an 
advanced search on Citation metadata fields as well as domain specific metadata fields depending on the metadata
selected for your Dataverse (Social Sciences & Humanities, Geospatial
Astronomy & Astrophysics, and Life Sciences). Additionally, you can perform an advanced search for dataverses and files.

To perform an advanced search, click the "Advanced Search" link next to the search bar. There you will have the ability to 
enter search terms for Dataverses, Dataset Metadata (citation and domain-specific), and file-level 
metadata. If you are searching for tabular data files you can also search at the variable level for name and label. To find 
out more about what each field searches, hover over the field name for a detailed description of the field.


Browsing Dataverse
--------------------

You can browse selected dataverses or all of LibraData from the home page by clicking on a dataverse at the bottom of the page, or select “Browse all LibraData Datasets” to browse all of LibraData. Browsing is the default for a user when they are on a specific dataverse's page. When browsing, only dataverses and datasets appear in the results list and the results can be sorted by Name (A-Z or Z-A) and by Newest or Oldest.


Using Data
=============

View Dataverses + Datasets
------------------------------

After performing a search and finding the dataverse or dataset you are looking for, click on the name of the dataverse or dataset or on the thumbnail image to be taken to the page for that dataverse or dataset. Once on a dataverse page, you can view the dataverses, datasets, and files within that dataverse.

Once on a dataset page, you will see the title, citation, description, and several other fields as well as a button to email the dataset contact. Below that information, the files, metadata, and version information for the dataset are available. 


View Files
--------------------

Files in Dataverse each have their own page that can be reached through the search results or through the Files table on their parent dataset’s page. The dataset page and file page offer much the same functionality in terms of viewing and editing files, with a few small exceptions. The file page includes the file’s persistent identifier (DOI or handle), which can be found under the Metadata tab. Also, the file page’s Versions tab gives you a version history that is more focused on the individual file rather than the dataset as a whole.


Cite Data
--------------------------

You can find the citation for the dataset at the top of the dataset page in a blue box. Additionally, there is a "Cite Data" button that offers the option to download the citation as EndNote XML, RIS Format, or BibTeX Format.

Download Files
-----------------

Within the Files tab on a dataset page, you can download the files in that dataset. To download more than one file at a time, select the files you would like to download and then click the "Download" button above the files. The selected files will download in zip format.

Tabular Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ingested files can be downloaded in several different ways.

- The default option is to download a tab-separated-value file which is an easy and free standard to use.
- The original file, which may be in a proprietary format which requires special software
- Rdata format if the installation has configured this
- The variable metadata for the file in DDI format
- A subset of the columns of the data

With tabular data files, a user can download the Original File Format, Tab Delimited Format, Variable Metadata, Data File Citation (RIS Format, EndNote XML, or BibTeX Format), or Subset (options appear depending on file format). 

Downloading via URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dataverse displays a plaintext URL for the location of the file under the Metadata tab on the dataset page. This Download URL can be used to directly access the file via API (or in a web browser, if needed).
