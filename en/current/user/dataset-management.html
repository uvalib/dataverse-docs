<div class="section" id="supported-metadata">
<h2>Supported Metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#supported-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A dataset contains three levels of metadata:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Citation Metadata</strong>: any metadata that would be needed for generating a data citation and other general metadata that could be applied to any dataset;</li>
<li><strong>Domain specific Metadata</strong>: with specific support currently for Social Science, Life Science, Geospatial, and Astronomy datasets; and</li>
<li><strong>File-level Metadata</strong>: varies depending on the type of data file - see <em>File Handling and Uploading</em> section below for more details).</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details about what Citation and Domain specific metadata is supported please see our <a class="reference external" href="../user/appendix.html#metadata-references">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h3>Tabular Data Files<a class="headerlink" href="#tabular-data-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Files in certain formats - Stata, SPSS, R, Excel(xlsx) and CSV - may
be ingested as tabular data (see &#8220;Tabular Data Ingest&#8221; section for
details).</p>
<p>COMING SOON:
Tabular data files can be further explored and manipulated
with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> - a
statistical data exploration application integrated with Dataverse. It
allows the user to run statistical models, view summary statistics,
download subsets of variable vectors and more. To start, click on the &#8220;Explore&#8221;
button, found next to each relevant tabular file (the application
will be opened in a new window). To download subsets of variables
click on the &#8220;Download&#8221; button found next to a relevant tabular file
and select &#8220;Data Subset&#8221; in the dropdown menu. You will then be able
to create your subset using the interface opened in a new window (this
functionality is also provided by the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> project). See the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens
documentation section</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>To use the ingest functionality for tabular files, a file can only be up to 2GB in size, however, to upload a tabular file without using ingest, a file can be up to 6GB in size.</p>
<p><strong>For files larger that 6GB, please contact libra&#64;virginia.edu for upload assistance.</strong></p>
<p>To use the ingest functionality for RData files, a file can only be up to 1MB in size, however, to upload a RData file without using ingest, a file can be up to 2GB in size.</p>
<p>Additional download options available for tabular data (found
in the same drop-down menu under the &#8220;Download&#8221; button):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As tab-delimited data (with the variable names in the first row);</li>
<li>The original file uploaded by the user;</li>
<li>Saved as R data (if the original file was not in R format);</li>
<li>Variable Metadata (as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">DDI Codebook</a> XML file);</li>

<h3>Geospatial<a class="headerlink" href="#geospatial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Geospatial <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> can be further explored and manipulated through our integration
with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/worldmap.html">WorldMap</a>, a geospatial data visualization
and analysis tool developed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://gis.harvard.edu/">Center for Geographic Analysis</a> at Harvard University. A shapefile is a set of files, often uploaded/transferred in .zip format.  This set may contain up to 15 files.  A minimum of 3 specific files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) are needed to be a valid shapefile and a 4th file (.prj) is required for WorldMap&#8211;or any type of meaningful visualization.</p>
<p>For ingest into Dataverse and connecting to WorldMap, these 4 files are the minimum required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself</li>
<li>.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly</li>
<li>.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format</li>
<li>.prj - projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format</li>
</ul>
<p>For a zipped shapefile, we require 4 files with these extensions. Other files may be included within the zipped shapefile, but they are not required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp</li>
<li>.shx</li>
<li>.prj</li>
<li>.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if these files were included within a .zip, the “Map Data” button would appear:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>subway_line.shp</li>
<li>subway_line.shx</li>
<li>subway_line.prj</li>
<li>subway_line.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you publish your dataset with your shape files, you will be able to use the &#8220;Map Data&#8221; button using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect">GeoConnect</a> to visualize and manipulate these files
for users to Explore this geospatial data using the <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> interface.
Please note: In order to map your data file, a copy will be sent to Harvard&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> platform. You have the ability to delete any maps, and associated data, from the Harvard WorldMap platform, at any time.</p>

<div class="section" id="replace-files">
<h2>Replace Files<a class="headerlink" href="#replace-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>n cases where you would like to revise an existing file rather than add a new one, you can do so using our Replace File feature. This will allow you to track the history of this file across versions of your dataset, both before and after replacing it. This could be useful for updating your data or fixing mistakes in your data. Because replacing a file creates an explicit link between the previous dataset version and the current version, the file replace feature is not available for unpublished dataset drafts. Also note that replacing a file will not automatically carry over that file’s metadata, but once the file is replaced then its original metadata can still be found by referencing the previous version of the file under the “Versions” tab of the file page.</p>
<p>To replace a file, go to the file page for that file, click on the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown list select “Replace”. This will bring you to the Replace File page, where you can see the metadata for the most recently published version of the file and you can upload your replacement file. Once you have uploaded the replacement file, you can edit its name, description, and tags. When you’re finished, click the “Save Changes” button.</p>
<p>After successfully replacing a file, a new dataset draft version will be created. A summary of your actions will be recorded in the “Versions” tab on on both the dataset page and file page. The Versions tab allows you to access all previous versions of the file across all previous versions of your dataset, including the old version of the file before you replaced it.</p>

<p>In the Terms tab, which can also be found by clicking on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; dropdown button of a dataset, you can setup how users can use your data once they have downloaded it (CC0 waiver or custom Terms of Use) and how they can access your data if you have files that are restricted (terms of access). These are explained in further detail below:</p>
<div class="section" id="cc0-public-domain-dedication">
<h3>CC0 Public Domain Dedication<a class="headerlink" href="#cc0-public-domain-dedication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ll new datasets created through Dataverse’s web UI are given a Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons organization defines a number of licenses that allow copyright holders to release their intellectual property more openly, with fewer legal restrictions than standard copyright enforces. Each Creative Commons license typically specifies simple terms for how the IP must be used, reused, shared, and attributed. In addition to these licenses, Creative Commons also provides public domain tools that make it easy to dedicate IP to the public domain.</p>
<p>In the context of Dataverse, their CC0 Public Domain Dedication allows you to unambiguously waive all copyright control over your data in all jurisdictions worldwide. Data released with CC0 can be freely copied, modified, and distributed (even for commercial purposes) without violating copyright. In most parts of the world, factual data is exempt from copyright anyway, but applying CC0 removes all ambiguity and makes the legal copyright status of the data as clear as possible. Dataverse applies CC0 to datasets by default because it facilitates reuse, extensibility, and long-term preservation of research data by assuring that the data can be safely handled by anyone without fear of potential copyright pitfalls.</p>
<p>Though CC0 waives a dataset owner’s legal copyright controls over the data, it does not exempt Dataverse users from following ethical and professional norms in scholarly communications. The Dataverse Community Norms * as well as scientific best practices assert that proper credit should be given via citation. Regardless of whether CC0 has been applied or not, Dataverse users are expected to cite the data they use, giving credit to the data’s authors. This expectation applies to both the Dataverse Community and the entire wider scholarly community.</p>
<p>Additionally, users are still expected to respect access restrictions and other terms applied to CC0 files in Dataverse. Additional restrictions, conditions, and terms can still be compatible with CC0, as CC0 only operates in the realm of copyright, which is rather limited when it comes to data.</p>
<p>If a data owner feels that CC0 is not suitable for their data, they are able to enter custom Terms of Use, as detailed in the following section.</p>
<p>* <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> these <a class="reference external" href="http://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/datasets/libra-data-community-norms/">Community Norms</a> are not a substitute for the CC0 waiver or custom terms and licenses applicable to each dataset. Please be advised that the Community Norms are not a binding contractual agreement, and that downloading datasets from Dataverse does not create a legal obligation to follow these policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="custom-terms-of-use-for-datasets">
<h3>Custom Terms of Use for Datasets<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-terms-of-use-for-datasets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are unable to use a CC0 waiver for your datasets you are able to set your own custom terms of use. To do so, select
&#8220;No, do not apply CC0 - &#8220;Public Domain Dedication&#8221; and a Terms of Use textbox will show up allowing you to enter your own custom terms of use for your dataset.</p>
<p>To add more information about the Terms of Use, you can use fields like Special Permissions, Restrictions, Citation Requirements, etc., click on &#8220;Additional Information [+]&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Restricted Files + Terms of Access<a class="headerlink" href="#restricted-files-terms-of-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

This can also be edited in the Terms tab or selecting Terms in the &#8220;Edit&#8221; dropdown button in the dataset. You may also allow users to request access for your restricted files by enabling &#8220;Request Access&#8221;. To add more information about the Terms of Access, click on &#8220;Additional Information [+]&#8221;. The University of Virginia does not recommend restricting files as the purpose of LibraData is to share &#8220;Openly&#8221; your scholarship.

<p>Dataverse user accounts can be granted roles that define which actions they are allowed to take on specific dataverses, datasets, and/or files. Each role comes with a set of permissions, which define the specific actions that users may take.</p>
<p>Roles and permissions may also be granted to groups. Groups can be defined as a collection of Dataverse user accounts, a collection of IP addresses (e.g. all users of a library&#8217;s computers), or a collection of all users who log in using a particular institutional login (e.g. everyone who logs in with a particular university&#8217;s account credentials).</p>
<div class="section" id="dataset-level">
<h3>Dataset-Level<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Admins or curators of a dataset can assign roles and permissions to the users of that dataset. If you are an admin or curator of a dataset, then you can get to the dataset permissions page by clicking the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button, highlighting &#8220;Permissions&#8221; from the dropdown list, and clicking &#8220;Dataset&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you access a dataset&#8217;s permissions page, you will see two sections:</p>
<p><strong>Users/Groups:</strong> Here you can assign roles to specific users or groups, determining which actions they are permitted to take on your dataset. You can also reference a list of all users who have roles assigned to them for your dataset and remove their roles if you please. Some of the users listed may have roles assigned at the dataverse level, in which case those roles can only be removed from the dataverse permissions page.</p>
<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Here you can reference a full list of roles that can be assigned to users of your dataset. Each role lists the permissions that it offers.</p>

<h3>File-Level<a class="headerlink" href="#file-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If specific files in your dataset are restricted access, then you can grant specific users or groups access to those files while still keeping them restricted to the general public. If you are an admin or curator of a dataset, then you can get to the file-level permissions page by clicking the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button, highlighting &#8220;Permissions&#8221; from the dropdown list, and clicking &#8220;File&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you access a dataset&#8217;s file-level permissions page, you will see two sections:</p>
<p><strong>Users/Groups:</strong> Here you can see which users or groups have been granted access to which files. You can click the &#8220;Grant Access to Users/Groups&#8221; button to see a box where you can grant access to specific files within your dataset to specific users or groups. If any users have requested access to a file in your dataset, you can grant or reject their access request here.</p>
<p><strong>Restricted Files:</strong> In this section, you can see the same information, but broken down by each individual file in your dataset. For each file, you can click the &#8220;Assign Access&#8221; button to see a box where you can grant access to that file to specific users or groups.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-provenance">
<span id="provenance"></span><h2>Data Provenance<a class="headerlink" href="#data-provenance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data Provenance is a record of where your data came from and how it reached its current form. It describes the origin of a data file, any transformations that have been made to that file, and any persons or organizations associated with that file. A data file’s provenance can aid in reproducibility and compliance with legal regulations. Dataverse can help you keep track of your data’s provenance. Currently, Dataverse only makes provenance information available to those who have edit permissions on your dataset, but in the near future we plan to expand this feature to make provenance information available to the public.</p>
<p>Dataverse accepts provenance information in two forms: a Provenance File or a free-text Provenance Description. You can attach this provenance information to your data files in Dataverse as part of the file upload process, by clicking Edit -&gt; Provenance:</p>
<p><img alt="prov0" src="../_images/prov0.png" /></p>
<p>This will open a window where you can add your Provenance File and/or Provenance Description:</p>
<p><img alt="prov1" src="../_images/prov1.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Provenance File</strong> is the preferred way of submitting provenance information to Dataverse because it provides a detailed and trustworthy record. Provenance files are typically generated during the process of data analysis, using provenance capture tools like provR, RDataTracker, NoWorkFlow, recordr, or CamFlow.</div></blockquote>
<p>Once you upload a provenance file, Dataverse will need some additional information in order to accurately connect it to your data file. Once provenance file upload finishes, an input box labeled &#8220;Connect entity&#8221; will appear under the file. Provenance files contain a list of &#8220;entities&#8221;, which include your data file as well as any objects associated with it (e.g. a chart, a spellchecker, etc.). You will need to tell Dataverse which entity within the provenance file represents your data file. You may type the name of the entity into the box, or click the arrow next to the box and select the entity from a list of all entities in the provenance file.</p>
<p>For more information on entities and the contents of provenance files, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/#intuitive-overview-of-prov">the W3C PROV Model Primer</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve uploaded your Provenance File and connected the proper entity, you can hit the Preview button to view the raw JSON of the Provenance File. This can help you confirm that you&#8217;ve uploaded the right file. Be sure to double-check it, because the Provenance File will made <em>permanent</em> once it&#8217;s finalized. At that point you will not be able to <em>replace</em>, <em>remove</em>, or otherwise <em>edit</em> the Provenance File. This ensures that the Provenance File maintains a stable, immutable record of the data file&#8217;s history. This finalization of the Provenance File happens at different points depending on the status of your data file. If this is a brand new data file that has never been published before, then its associated Provenance File will be made permanent once you publish the dataset. If this data file <em>has</em> been published in a previous version of your dataset, then its associated Provenance File will be made permanent as soon as you upload the Provenance File and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; on the warning popup.</p>
<p>A <strong>Provenance Description</strong> allows you to add more provenance information in addition to or in place of a provenance file. This is a free-text field that allows you to enter any information you feel might be relevant to those interested in learning about the provenance of your data. This might be a good place to describe provenance factors like what operating system you used when working with the data file, what functions or libraries you used, how data was merged into the file, what version of the file you used, etc. The Provenance Description is not as useful or trustworthy as a provenance file, but it can still provide value. Unlike the Provenance File, the Provenance Description is never made permanent: you can always edit, remove, or replace it at any time.</p>
<p>You can return to attach provenance to your data file later on by clicking the &#8220;Add + Edit Metadata&#8221; button on the file page, and then clicking the &#8220;Edit -&gt; Provenance&#8221; button.</p>

<div class="section" id="thumbnails">
<h3>Thumbnails<a class="headerlink" href="#thumbnails" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Thumbnail images can be assigned to a dataset manually or automatically. The thumbnail for a dataset appears on the search result card for that dataset and on the dataset page itself. If a dataset contains one or more data files that Dataverse recognizes as an image, then one of those images is automatically selected as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p>If you would like to manually select your dataset’s thumbnail, you can do so by clicking the “Edit” button on your dataset, and selecting “Thumbnails + Widgets” from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>On this page, under the Thumbnail tab you will see three possible actions.</p>
<p><strong>Select Available File:</strong> Click the “Select Thumbnail” button to choose an image from your dataset to use as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p><strong>Upload New File:</strong> Upload an image file from your computer to use as the dataset thumbnail. While by default your thumbnail image is drawn from a file in your dataset, this will allow you to upload a separate image file to use as your dataset thumbnail. This uploaded image file will only be used as the dataset thumbnail; it will not be stored as a data file in your dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Remove Thumbnail:</strong> If you click the “Remove” button under the thumbnail image, you will remove the dataset’s current thumbnail. The Dataset will then revert to displaying a basic default icon as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p>When you’re finished on this page, be sure to click “Save Changes” to save what you’ve done.</p>
<p>Note: If you prefer, it is also possible to set an image file in your dataset as your thumbnail by selecting the file, going to Edit Files -&gt; Metadata, and using the “Set Thumbnail” button.</p>

<h3>Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Widgets feature provides you with code for your personal website so your dataset can be displayed. There are two types of Widgets for a dataset: the Dataset Widget and the Dataset Citation Widget. The Widgets are found by going to your dataset page, clicking the Edit button (the one with the pencil icon) and selecting Widgets from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>In the Widgets tab, you can copy and paste the code snippets for the widget you would like to add to your website. If you need to adjust the height of the widget on your website, you may do so by editing the <cite>heightPx=500</cite> parameter in the code snippet.</p>
<div class="section" id="dataset-widget">
<h4>Dataset Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Dataset Widget allows the citation, metadata, files and terms of your dataset to be displayed on your website. When someone downloads a data file in the widget, it will download directly from the datasets on your website. If a file is restricted, they will be directed to your dataverse to log in, instead of logging in through the widget on your site.</p>
<p>To edit your dataset, you will need to return to the Dataverse repository where the dataset is stored. You can easily do this by clicking on the link that says &#8220;Data Stored in (Name) Dataverse&#8221; found in the bottom of the widget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dataset-citation-widget">
<h4>Dataset Citation Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-citation-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<h2>Publish Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#publish-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you publish a dataset (available to an Admin, Curator, or any custom role which has this level of permission assigned), you make it available to the public so that other users can browse or search for it. Once your dataset is ready to go public, go to your dataset page and click on the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button on the right hand side of the page. A pop-up will appear (see below)  to confirm that you are ready to actually Publish since <strong>once a dataset is made public it can no longer be unpublished or deleted</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/publish-popup.png" /></p>
<p>Whenever you edit your dataset, you are able to publish a new version of the dataset. The publish dataset button will reappear whenever you edit the metadata of the dataset or add a file.</p>
<p>Note: Prior to publishing your dataset the Data Citation will indicate that this is a draft but the &#8220;DRAFT VERSION&#8221; text
will be removed as soon as you Publish.</p>

<h2>Dataset Versioning<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-versioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Versioning is important for long term-research data management where metadata and/or files are updated over time. It is used to track any metadata or file changes (e.g., by uploading a new file, changing file metadata, adding or editing metadata) once you have published your dataset.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/version_workflow.png" /></p>
<p>Once you edit your published dataset a new draft version of this dataset will be created. To publish this new version of your dataset, select the “Publish Dataset” button on the top right side of the page. If you were at version 1 of your dataset, depending on the types of changes you had made, you would be asked to publish your draft as either version 1.1 or version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you add a file, your dataset will automatically be bumped up to a major version (e.g., if you were at 1.0 you will go to 2.0).</p>
<p>On the Versions tab of a dataset page, there is a versions table that displays the version history of the dataset. You can use the version number links in this table to navigate between the different versions of the dataset, including the unpublished draft version, if you have permission to access it.</p>
<p>There is also a Versions tab on the file page. The versions table for a file displays the same information as the dataset, but the summaries are filtered down to only show the actions related to that file. If a new dataset version were created without any changes to an individual file, that file’s version summary for that dataset version would read “No changes associated with this version”.</p>
<div class="section" id="version-details">
<h3>Version Details<a class="headerlink" href="#version-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To view what has exactly changed starting from the originally published version to any subsequent published versions: click the Versions tab on the dataset page to see all versions and changes made for that particular dataset.</p>
<p>Once you have more than one version (can be version 1 and a draft), you can click the “View Details” link next to each summary to learn more about the metadata fields and files that were either added or edited. You can also click the checkboxes to select any two dataset versions, then click the “View Differences” button to open the Version Differences Details popup and compare the differences between them.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is not recommended that you deaccession a dataset or a version of a dataset. This is a very serious action that should only occur if there is a legal or valid reason for the dataset to no longer be accessible to the public. If you absolutely must deaccession, you can deaccession a version of a dataset or an entire dataset.</p>
</div>
<p>To deaccession, go to your published dataset (or add a new one and publish it), click the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown menu select “Deaccession Dataset”. If you have multiple versions of a dataset, you can select here which versions you want to deaccession or choose to deaccession the entire dataset.</p>
<p>You must also include a reason as to why this dataset was deaccessioned. Select the most appropriate reason from the dropdown list of options. If you select “Other”, you must also provide additional information.</p>
<p>Add more information as to why this was deaccessioned in the free-text box. If the dataset has moved to a different repository or site you are encouraged to include a URL (preferably persistent) for users to continue to be able to access this dataset in the future.</p>
<p>If you deaccession the most recently published version of the dataset but not all versions of the dataset, you are able to go in and create a new draft for the dataset. For example, you have a version 1 and version 2 of a dataset, both published, and deaccession version 2. You are then able to edit version 1 of the dataset and a new draft will be created.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: A tombstone landing page with the basic citation metadata will always be accessible to the public if they use the persistent URL (Handle or DOI) provided in the citation for that dataset.  Users will not be able to see any of the files or additional metadata that were previously available prior to deaccession.</p>
