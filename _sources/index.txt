How the Guides Are Organized
=============================

The Guides are reference documents that explain how to use LibraData, the local instance of Dataverse installed at UVA.
The User Guide is divided into primary activities: finding & using
data, adding Datasets, administering dataverses or Datasets, and Dataset exploration/visualizations. Details
on all of the above tasks can be found in the Users Guide.
