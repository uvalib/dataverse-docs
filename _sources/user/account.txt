My Data
---------------------------
The My Data section of your account page displays a listing of all the datasets, and files you have either created, uploaded or that you have access to edit. You are able to filter through all the datasets, and files listed there using the filter box or use the facets on the left side to only view a specific Publication Status or Role.  


Notifications: Setup & Maintenance

You will receive a notification when:

- You've created your account

Libra Data will email your unread notifications once a day. Notifications will only be emailed one time even if you haven't read the notification on the Dataverse site.
