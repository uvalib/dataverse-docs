Email recipient depends on context of where the envelope appears. On Dataverse pages (top UVa Level and sub, department levels), the email goes to UVA Libra Data Support (libra@virginia.edu)

If you are viewing a personal dataset, then the email will go to the creator of the dataset.

Plus sign

If you are in a sub, departmental dataverse, the search will search the top level dataverse and other sub dataverses. If you use the search box above the list of datasets, the current dataverse will be searched. If the current dataverse is the top-level, then all sub dataverses will be searched.

Asterisks

Publish Datasets

|image10|

When you publish a dataset, you make it available to the public so that other users can browse or search for it. Note: UVa depositors MUST acknowledge the following:

#. You have the legal right and authorization to make the data publicly available online world-wide through Libra.
#. In preparing the data for public archiving and distribution, you have removed any confidential or sensitive information, student education records protected under FERPA, and all information that personally identifies any individual or that contains any information classified as highly sensitive under state or federal law, or UVA policy. 
#. If the submission is based upon work that has been sponsored or supported by an agency or organization other than UVA such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, or a private sponsor or funder, you represent that you have fulfilled any right of review, confidentiality, or other obligations required by that contract or agreement.
#. You represent that you have made a reasonable effort to ensure that the data contained in your submission is accurate.
#. You represent that you have appropriately acknowledged other researchers whose work contributed to the data.

Tabular Data Ingest
-------------------
Files in certain formats - Stata, SPSS, R, Excel(xlsx) and CSV - may be ingested as tabular data. Files that are recognized as tabular data and not flagged can be used in applications integrated with Dataverse.

If dataverse considers your file “tabular” it will try to  convert the raw data content extracted from such files in plain text, TAB-delimited files. If there is a problem, your files will still be uploaded, but you will see the following icon next to those files:
|image11|

Hovering over the warning icon displays detailed information, such as: 
|image12|

Once the dataset is published, this symbol is not seen by the public. The owner of the data file will still see the icon.
