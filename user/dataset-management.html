<p>A dataset contains three levels of metadata:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Citation Metadata</strong>: any metadata that would be needed for generating a data citation and other general metadata that could be applied to any dataset;</li>
<li><strong>Domain specific Metadata</strong>: with specific support currently for Social Science, Life Science, Geospatial, and Astronomy datasets; and</li>
<li><strong>File-level Metadata</strong>: varies depending on the type of data file - see <em>File Handling and Uploading</em> section below for more details).</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details about what Citation and Domain specific metadata is supported please see our <a class="reference external" href="../user/appendix.html#metadata-references">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Supported Metadata Export Formats</a><a class="headerlink" href="#supported-metadata-export-formats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once a dataset has been published, its metadata can be exported in a variety of other metadata standards and formats, which help make datasets more discoverable and usable in other systems, such as other data repositories. On each dataset page’s metadata tab, the following exports are available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dublin Core</li>
<li>DDI (Data Documentation Initiative Codebook 2.5)</li>
<li>DDI HTML Codebook (A more human-readable, HTML version of the DDI Codebook 2.5 metadata export)</li>
<li>DataCite 4</li>
<li>JSON (native Dataverse format)</li>
<li>OAI_ORE</li>
<li>OpenAIRE</li>
<li>Schema.org JSON-LD</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these metadata exports contains the metadata of the most recently published version of the dataset.</p>
<p>Note that once a dataset has been published its metadata may be exported. A button on the dataset page’s metadata tab will allow a user to export the metadata of the most recently published version of the dataset. Currently supported export formats are DDI, Dublin Core, Datacite 4, OAI_ORE, Schema.org JSON-LD, and Dataverse’s native JSON format.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Command-line DVUploader</a><a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-dvuploader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The open-source DVUploader tool is a stand-alone command-line Java application that uses the Dataverse API to upload files to a specified Dataset. Since it can be installed by users, and requires no server-side configuration, it can be used with any Dataverse installation. It is intended as an alternative to uploading files through the Dataverse web interface in situations where the web interface is inconvenient due to the number of files or file locations (spread across multiple directories, mixed with files that have already been uploaded or file types that should be excluded) or the need to automate uploads. Since it uses the Dataverse API, transfers are limited in the same ways as HTTP uploads through the Dataverse web interface in terms of size and performance. The DVUploader logs its activity and can be killed and restarted as desired. If stopped and resumed, it will continue processing from where it left off.</p>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Usage</a><a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The DVUploader is open source and is available as source, as a Java jar, and with documentation at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-uploader">https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-uploader</a>. The DVUploader requires Java 1.8+. Users will need to install Java if they don’t already have it and then download the DVUploader-v1.0.0.jar file. Users will need to know the URL of the Dataverse server, the DOI of their existing Dataverse Dataset, and have generated a Dataverse API Key (an option in the user’s profile menu).</p>
<p>Basic usage is to run the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">java</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jar</span> <span class="n">DVUploader</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mf">0.0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">jar</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">=&lt;</span><span class="n">Dataverse</span> <span class="n">server</span> <span class="n">URL</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">did</span><span class="o">=&lt;</span><span class="n">Dataset</span> <span class="n">DOI</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=&lt;</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="s1">&#39;s API Key&gt; &lt;file or directory list&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Additional command line arguments are available to make the DVUploader list what it would do without uploading, limit the number of files it uploads, recurse through sub-directories, verify fixity, exclude files with specific extensions or name patterns, and/or wait longer than 60 seconds for any Dataverse ingest lock to clear (e.g. while the previously uploaded file is processed, as discussed in the <span class="xref std std-ref">File Handling</span> section below).</p>
<p>DVUploader is a community-developed tool, and its creation was primarily supported by the Texas Digital Library. Further information and support for DVUploader can be sought at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-uploader">the project’s GitHub repository</a> .</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Duplicate Files</a><a class="headerlink" href="#duplicate-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Beginning with Dataverse 5.0, the way Dataverse handles duplicate files (filename and checksums) is changing to be more flexible. Specifically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Files with the same checksum can be included in a dataset, even if the files are in the same directory.</li>
<li>Files with the same filename can be included in a dataset as long as the files are in different directories.</li>
<li>If a user uploads a file to a directory where a file already exists with that directory/filename combination, Dataverse will adjust the file path and names by adding “-1” or “-2” as applicable. This change will be visible in the list of files being uploaded.</li>
<li>If the directory or name of an existing or newly uploaded file is edited in such a way that would create a directory/filename combination that already exists, Dataverse will display an error.</li>
<li>If a user attempts to replace a file with another file that has the same checksum, an error message will be displayed and the file will not be able to be replaced.</li>
<li>If a user attempts to replace a file with a file that has the same checksum as a different file in the dataset, a warning will be displayed.</li>

<p>Certain file types in Dataverse are supported by additional functionality, which can include downloading in different formats, subsets, file-level metadata preservation, file-level data citation; and exploration through data visualization and analysis. See the sections below for information about special functionality for specific file types.</p>

<p>Files in certain formats - Stata, SPSS, R, Excel(xlsx) and CSV - may
be ingested as tabular data (see “Tabular Data Ingest” section for
details).</p>
<p>COMING SOON:
Tabular data files can be further explored and manipulated
with <a class="reference external" href="http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> - a
statistical data exploration application integrated with Dataverse. It
allows the user to run statistical models, view summary statistics,
download subsets of variable vectors and more. To start, click on the “Explore”
button, found next to each relevant tabular file (the application
will be opened in a new window). To download subsets of variables
click on the “Download” button found next to a relevant tabular file
and select “Data Subset” in the dropdown menu. You will then be able
to create your subset using the interface opened in a new window (this
functionality is also provided by the <a class="reference external" href="http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> project). See the <a class="reference external" href="http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens
documentation section</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>To use the ingest functionality for tabular files, a file can only be up to 2GB in size, however, to upload a tabular file without using ingest, a file can be up to 6GB in size.</p>
<p><strong>For files larger that 6GB, please contact libra&#64;virginia.edu for upload assistance.</strong></p>
<p>Additional download options available for tabular data (found
in the same drop-down menu under the “Download” button):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The original file uploaded by the user;</li>
<li>As tab-delimited data (with the variable names in the first row);</li>
<li>Saved as R data (if the original file was not in R format);</li>
<li>Variable Metadata (as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">DDI Codebook</a> XML file);</li>

<p>Geospatial <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> can be further explored and manipulated through an optional integration with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/worldmap.html">WorldMap</a>, a geospatial data visualization and analysis tool developed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://gis.harvard.edu/">Center for Geographic Analysis</a> at Harvard University. A shapefile is a set of files, often uploaded/transferred in .zip format.  This set may contain up to 15 files.  A minimum of 3 specific files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) are needed to be a valid shapefile and a 4th file (.prj) is required for WorldMap–or any type of meaningful visualization.</p>
<p>For ingest into Dataverse and connecting to WorldMap, these 4 files are the minimum required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself</li>
<li>.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly</li>
<li>.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format</li>
<li>.prj - projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format</li>
</ul>
<p>For a zipped shapefile, we require 4 files with these extensions. Other files may be included within the zipped shapefile, but they are not required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp</li>
<li>.shx</li>
<li>.prj</li>

<p>Compressed files in .zip format are unpacked automatically. If a .zip file fails to unpack for whatever reason, it will upload as is. If the number of files inside are more than a set limit (1,000 by default, configurable by the Administrator), you will get an error message and the .zip file will upload as is.</p>
<p>If the uploaded .zip file contains a folder structure, Dataverse will keep track of this structure. A file’s location within this folder structure is displayed in the file metadata as the File Path. When you download the contents of the dataset, this folder structure will be preserved and files will appear in their original locations.</p>
<p>These folder names are subject to strict validation rules. Only the following characters are allowed: the alphanumerics, ‘_’, ‘-‘, ‘.’ and ‘ ‘ (white space). When a zip archive is uploaded, the folder names are automatically sanitized, with any invalid characters replaced by the ‘.’ character. Any sequences of dots are further replaced with a single dot. For example, the folder name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data&amp;info/code=&#64;137</span></code> will be converted to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data.info/code.137</span></code>. When uploading through the Web UI, the user can change the values further on the edit form presented, before clicking the ‘Save’ button.</p>

<p>The File Path metadata field is Dataverse’s way of representing a file’s location in a folder structure. When a user uploads a .zip file containing a folder structure, Dataverse automatically fills in the File Path information for each file contained in the .zip. If a user downloads the full dataset or a selection of files from it, they will receive a folder structure with each file positioned according to its File Path.</p>
<p>A file’s File Path can be manually added or edited on the Edit Files page. Changing a file’s File Path will change its location in the folder structure that is created when a user downloads the full dataset or a selection of files from it.</p>
<p>If there is more than one file in the dataset, and once at least one of them has a non-empty directory path, the Dataset Page will present an option for switching between the traditional table view, and the tree-like view of the files showing the folder structure, as in the example below:</p>

<p>In cases where you would like to revise an existing file rather than add a new one, you can do so using our Replace File feature. This will allow you to track the history of this file across versions of your dataset, both before and after replacing it. This could be useful for updating your data or fixing mistakes in your data. Because replacing a file creates an explicit link between the previous dataset version and the current version, the file replace feature is not available for unpublished dataset drafts. Also note that replacing a file will not automatically carry over that file’s metadata, but once the file is replaced then its original metadata can still be found by referencing the previous version of the file under the “Versions” tab of the file page.</p>
<p>To replace a file, go to the file page for that file, click on the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown list select “Replace”. This will bring you to the Replace File page, where you can see the metadata for the most recently published version of the file and you can upload your replacement file. Once you have uploaded the replacement file, you can edit its name, description, and tags. When you’re finished, click the “Save Changes” button.</p>
<p>After successfully replacing a file, a new dataset draft version will be created. A summary of your actions will be recorded in the “Versions” tab on on both the dataset page and file page. The Versions tab allows you to access all previous versions of the file across all previous versions of your dataset, including the old version of the file before you replaced it.</p>

<p>Dataset terms can be viewed and edited from the Terms tab of the dataset page, or under the Edit dropdown button of a Dataset. There, you can set up how users can use your data once they have downloaded it (CC0 waiver or custom Terms of Use), how they can access your data if you have files that are restricted (terms of access), and enable a Guestbook for your dataset so that you can track who is using your data and for what purposes. These are explained in further detail below:</p>
<div class="section" id="cc0-public-domain-dedication">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cc0-public-domain-dedication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, all new datasets created through Dataverse’s web UI are given a <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> organization defines a number of <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a> that allow copyright holders to release their intellectual property more openly, with fewer legal restrictions than standard copyright enforces. Each Creative Commons license typically specifies simple terms for how the IP must be used, reused, shared, and attributed. In addition to these licenses, Creative Commons also provides public domain tools that make it easy to dedicate IP to the public domain.</p>
<p>In the context of Dataverse, their <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> allows you to unambiguously waive all copyright control over your data in all jurisdictions worldwide. Data released with CC0 can be freely copied, modified, and distributed (even for commercial purposes) without violating copyright. In most parts of the world, factual data is exempt from copyright anyway, but applying CC0 removes all ambiguity and makes the legal copyright status of the data as clear as possible. Dataverse applies CC0 to datasets by default because it facilitates reuse, extensibility, and long-term preservation of research data by assuring that the data can be safely handled by anyone without fear of potential copyright pitfalls.</p>
<p>Though CC0 waives a dataset owner’s legal copyright controls over the data, it does not exempt Dataverse users from following ethical and professional norms in scholarly communications. The <a class="reference external" href="https://dataverse.org/best-practices/dataverse-community-norms">Dataverse Community Norms</a> * as well as scientific best practices assert that proper credit should be given via citation. Regardless of whether CC0 has been applied or not, Dataverse users are expected to cite the data they use, giving credit to the data’s authors. This expectation applies to both the Dataverse Community and the entire wider scholarly community.</p>
<p>Additionally, users are still expected to respect access restrictions and other terms applied to CC0 files in Dataverse. Additional restrictions, conditions, and terms can still be compatible with CC0, as CC0 only operates in the realm of copyright, which is rather limited when it comes to data.</p>
<p>If a data owner feels that CC0 is not suitable for their data, they are able to enter custom Terms of Use, as detailed in the following section.</p>
<p>* <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> these <a class="reference external" href="https://dataverse.org/best-practices/dataverse-community-norms">Community Norms</a> are not a substitute for the CC0 waiver or custom terms and licenses applicable to each dataset. The Community Norms are not a binding contractual agreement, and that downloading datasets from Dataverse does not create a legal obligation to follow these policies.</p>

“No, do not apply CC0 - “Public Domain Dedication” and a Terms of Use textbox will show up allowing you to enter your own custom terms of use for your dataset.</p>

<p>Versioning is important for long term-research data management where metadata and/or files are updated over time. It is used to track any metadata or file changes (e.g., by uploading a new file, changing file metadata, adding or editing metadata) once you have published your dataset.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/version_workflow.png" /></p>
<p>Once you edit your published dataset a new draft version of this dataset will be created. To publish this new version of your dataset, select the “Publish Dataset” button on the top right side of the page. If you were at version 1 of your dataset, depending on the types of changes you had made, you would be asked to publish your draft as either version 1.1 or version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you add a file, your dataset will automatically be bumped up to a major version (e.g., if you were at 1.0 you will go to 2.0).</p>
<p>On the Versions tab of a dataset page, there is a versions table that displays the version history of the dataset. You can use the version number links in this table to navigate between the different versions of the dataset, including the unpublished draft version, if you have permission to access it.</p>
<p>There is also a Versions tab on the file page. The versions table for a file displays the same information as the dataset, but the summaries are filtered down to only show the actions related to that file. If a new dataset version were created without any changes to an individual file, that file’s version summary for that dataset version would read “No changes associated with this version”.</p>

This is a very serious action that should only occur if there is a legal or valid reason for the dataset to no longer be accessible to the public. If you absolutely must deaccession, you can deaccession a version of a dataset or an entire dataset.</p>
</div>
<p>To deaccession, go to your published dataset (or add a new one and publish it), click the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown menu select “Deaccession Dataset”. If you have multiple versions of a dataset, you can select here which versions you want to deaccession or choose to deaccession the entire dataset.</p>
<p>You must also include a reason as to why this dataset was deaccessioned. Select the most appropriate reason from the dropdown list of options. If you select “Other”, you must also provide additional information.</p>
<p>Add more information as to why this was deaccessioned in the free-text box. If the dataset has moved to a different repository or site you are encouraged to include a URL (preferably persistent) for users to continue to be able to access this dataset in the future.</p>
<p>If you deaccession the most recently published version of the dataset but not all versions of the dataset, you are able to go in and create a new draft for the dataset. For example, you have a version 1 and version 2 of a dataset, both published, and deaccession version 2. You are then able to edit version 1 of the dataset and a new draft will be created.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: A tombstone landing page with the basic citation metadata will always be accessible to the public if they use the persistent URL (Handle or DOI) provided in the citation for that dataset.
